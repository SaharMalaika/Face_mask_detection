# Face_mask_detection
  **Overview**
  
This project is a deep learning-based solution for detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask. The model is trained to classify images into two categories: with mask and without mask. This project can be used for monitoring compliance with mask-wearing policies in public spaces, workplaces, and other environments.

  **Features**
  
Real-time Detection: The model can be deployed to detect face masks in real-time through video streams.
High Accuracy: Trained on a diverse dataset, the model is effective under various lighting conditions, face angles, and mask types.
Easy Integration: The codebase includes scripts that allow for easy integration into existing systems or deployment as a standalone application.
Pre-trained Model: A pre-trained model is provided, allowing you to start detecting masks without needing to train from scratch.
Customizable: The project is flexible and can be retrained with your own dataset to cater to specific requirements.

  **Dataset**
  
The model is trained on a dataset containing images labeled into two categories: with mask and without mask. The dataset comprises a variety of images with different backgrounds, lighting conditions, and face orientations, ensuring that the model can generalize well to new data.

  **Model Architecture**
  
This project utilizes a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed specifically for the task of face mask detection. The architecture has been optimized for performance and accuracy on the given dataset.
